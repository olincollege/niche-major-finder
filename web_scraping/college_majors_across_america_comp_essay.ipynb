    "# Distribution of College Majors Across Tops Schools in America\n",
    "Authors:  Rucha, Emma, Jiayuan\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "College students take multiple factors into consideration when choosing their majors. Some of these factors are ranking of majors in their college, potential future career path and salary, personal interest, etc. But are there any correlations between students' choices of major at top schools and the states that they study in? In this computational essay, we tried to explore the answer to this question and discuss the methods we used to anaylize the statistics of students' major choices in different states. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** Is there a correlation between the choice of major by students at top colleges and the state they study in? \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, top colleges is defined as the top 10% of colleges in each state as ranked by Niche.com. Our goal for this project was to explore the comparision of different majors in top schools across different states and see whether there are any patterns that come to light. We looked at both comparing results for different states and observing patterns across America as a whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the correlation between state and popular major choice will explain to us how location, state policy and culture impact major choices in many colleges across America. This could potentially be useful for students who are applying for college by helping them gain insight into the distribution of learning resources across the US for different majors. Additionally, companies who are hiring for specific majors could understand whether there are certain locations to target their resources towards.\n",
    "\n",
    "The three main steps we took in this project were web scrapping the data, cleaning and organizing the data, and visulizing the data for results. Each is documented in details in the sections below.\n",

    "## Methodology\n",
    "### Scrapping Data\n",
    "We scrapped our data by programmatically accessing pages from `niche.com`, a well-known college evaluation website (with the usage of an agent, time delays and a VPN to avoid being blocked by the website). \n",
    "\n",
    "We began by scraping the website for the college list for each state in the US. This included public and private schools as well as trade schools. For each state, we gathered the first page of results. From here, we found the total number of colleges displayed on Niche for each state and programmatically looped through the `top 10%` ranked colleges from the list to get the number of students in each major. The ranking provided by niche, although probably biased and not completely reflective of a college's true value, gives us a list of the overall more influencial schools in each state. The data extracted for each of the top 10% of schools in each state was saved into csv in the folder `raw_data`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each csv had a similar format with four columns: `State` , `Major` , `College` , `Student Number`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In total, we recorded 324 majors in 575 colleges across 50 states.\n",

    "### Organizing Data\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the organizing work was done through our `runner.py` file. \n",
    "\n",
    "We first began by concatenating every data file we had into a single file called `combined_data.csv`. This allowed us to more easily access the all of the data at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "We manually sorted all the majors into 53 categories, which were organized into a dictionary. For example, majors like `Acting`, `Theatre Design`, `Dance`, and `Drama and Theatre Production` can be found under the key `Arts`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find all the majors for this sorting, we ran the following code:"

    "\n",
    "3. The third csv summed the number of students who majored in a certain topic for all the states. For example, all the students in the US (all states from the list) were summed together. This was saved as `broader_major_whole_country.csv`"

    "First, to get a sense of the density of students in each major overall, we created a pie chart that shows the relative prevalence of each major in the US. \n",

    "This bar graph shows us that the ratio of top 10 majors' number of enrollment varies a lot across different states. California, for example, has more than 1/5 of enrollment in business major over all major, whereas connecticut has almost none out of all enrollment."

    "The result of this project reveals that the pravelence of major varies in different states. But there is not a single dominant pattern. Multiple interpretations can be made based on the results and through different types of graphs. Despite what the visuals look like, there could always be some bias behind the information and how it is portrayed. For example, the information conveyed by graph 1 and graph 2 are completely different, but they are generated with the same data.\n",
